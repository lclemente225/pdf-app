# This is my PDF Application

## Notes
I wanted to use the HTML canvas element and javascript for this project. I used some libraries to help with the pdf rendering and saving process. Adding and removing signatures was purely using the HTML canvas methods. I learned more about how the canvas works and manipulating data to render pdfs on the canvas as well as save them.
